# YAML seasonal catalog pilot

This is a sourced catalog for `micharisma-seeds/v1`, namespace `MIC`, catalog `ALA`. It adds YAML files alongside the existing JSON library. The original small pilot is retained, with latest completed-season team/player coverage under `coverage_2025/`.

The ten completed main-league seasons are NBA, NHL, and EPL `2016_2017` through `2025_2026`, plus NFL `2016` through `2025`. One additional Championship season supports Fulham's promotion example. `Season.label` preserves the complete label. Its `year` reference is the starting calendar year; an NFL label uses that season's designated year. Calendar dates are omitted rather than inferred.

## Coverage

The expansion supplies all 114 teams for NBA/NHL/EPL `2025_2026` and NFL `2025`: 30 NBA, 32 NFL, 32 NHL, and 20 EPL. Every team has at least two source-listed players in that season's Campaign. The Knicks and 49ers have every name in their captured official roster listings; the Blues have every skater/goalie with a regular-season appearance in the official archive. The base `coverage_2025/` manifests select two players for other teams. The [Play supplement](play_roster_expansion/README.md) adds the remaining captured NBA and NHL lists, so their teams have full captured source coverage when the whole library is imported. NFL and EPL retain their original sampling boundaries. Campaign `details.roster_coverage` distinguishes `complete_source_listing` from `two_player_sample`.

The October 5 capture selects 18 Knicks, 101 49ers, and 35 Blues players. The latest-season groups contain 376 memberships. Before the participation extension, coverage and pilot history together contain 361 distinct Players, 124 Campaigns, 382 Activations, and 1,048 code bindings across 1,043 definitions.

See [the capture and generator instructions](../sources/README.md) for source boundaries, offline regeneration, and refresh. A captured NBA roster, NFL roster sitemap, NHL season appearance list, and EPL senior registration list have different meanings; complete source coverage does not imply identical eligibility or appearance claims. This expansion does not supply complete rosters for all ten historical seasons.

`participation/` adds 114 sporting-club Organizations and primary-team affiliations, 82 NBA/NFL/EPL roster observations with 279 entries, and a sourced NHL history sample. Organization names represent sporting clubs and do not assert corporate ownership. Affiliation dates are unknown; minor affiliate coverage is still to be supplied.

The Leddy sample adds the March 2022 trade and assignment, July contract extension, a real March 22 game with his statistics, and a partial two-player October opening-night roster. The precise contract dates, stint end, and starter status remain unknown. Its 2022 extension is not treated as the original contract for the earlier stint. The trade's movement coverage is explicitly partial. NHL season-statistics participants remain Activations; they do not become invented roster observations or games.

The full recursive catalog now has 24 manifests, 4,537 definitions, and 4,542 code bindings: 114 Teams, 1,766 Players, 126 Campaigns, 1,864 Activations, 114 Organizations, 114 affiliations, 83 Rosters, 281 entries, one Contract, two Transactions and player movements, one Stint, one game Contest, two Contestants, and one Appearance, plus the original geography/sport/season anchors.

The original root-level pilot has these counts:

| Records | Count | Coverage |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Country | 2 | United States and United Kingdom jurisdiction anchors |
| Sport | 4 | Basketball, Football, Hockey, Soccer |
| League | 5 | NBA, NFL, NHL, EPL, and the secondary EFL Championship |
| Year | 10 | 2016 through 2025 |
| Season | 41 | Ten per main league; Championship 2021_2022 |
| Team | 8 | Two NBA, three NFL, two NHL, one English football club |
| Player | 3 | Josh Hart, Emmanuel Sanders, Nick Leddy |
| Campaign | 10 | Annual team attributes for the examples below |
| Activation | 6 | Two same-season memberships for each sampled traded player |
| Total catalog definitions | 89 | Samples only; no complete team roster is claimed |

NBA Hart `2022_2023`: Portland and New York. NFL Sanders `2019`: Denver and San Francisco. NHL Leddy `2021_2022`: Detroit and St. Louis. Raiders city history: Oakland in `2019`, Las Vegas in `2020`. Fulham league history: Championship `2021_2022`, EPL `2022_2023`.

An Activation asserts membership in that team's season, even when the player departed before the season ended. Both trade-side memberships remain. It does not assert membership for every day, opening-day presence, a particular game appearance, or a contract's terms. These files supply six membership observations; they do not enumerate the complete full-season unions for the sampled teams. Further roster captures must add the omitted people.

## Files and scopes

`foundation.yaml`, `years.yaml`, `seasons_*.yaml`, `teams.yaml`, and `players.yaml` define shared anchors. The five named sample files define Campaigns and membership observations. The importer indexes definitions across the selected files before resolving dependencies; filename order must not determine identity.

Each catalog file declares `format`, `namespace`, `catalog`, `source`, `scope`, and `groups`. Each group declares a scope and records. A record declares `type`, a full catalog-relative `code`, an `attributes` mapping, and a `references` mapping. It may additionally declare aliases or override its inherited source. There are no local database IDs in these references.

File scope and group scope provide relationship context; a group's explicit value replaces the corresponding inherited value. Records remain individually coded. For example:

```yaml
scope:
  sport: SPORT-BKT
  league: BKT-LEAGUE-NBA
  year: YEAR-2022
groups:
  - scope:
      team: BKT-NBA-TEAM-POR
    records:
      - type: Activation
        code: BKT-NBA-SEASON_2022_2023-TEAM-POR-PLAYER-HART_JOSH
        attributes: {}
        references:
          player: BKT-NBA-LAL-2017-HART_JOSH
```

The adapter derives Campaign team and Season from team/league/year context, and derives an Activation's Campaign from the same context. It resolves the explicit Player code, which is defined once in `players.yaml`. Player groups carry independent Sport context and no current team assignment. A debut-team component in a Player code is a historical identity anchor, not a request to overwrite `Player.team`.

Annual display name, territory, mascot, and abbreviation belong to Campaign. The Raiders' `FTB-NFL-TEAM-RAIDERS` identity has OAK and LV aliases and two separate annual snapshots. Fulham's `SOC-EPL-TEAM-FUL` remains one club when its Campaign league changes. The EPL component in that issued Team code is its catalog qualification; a Championship Campaign must not create a duplicate Team or rewrite its current league association.

Country jurisdiction references follow the current JSON catalog's United States/United Kingdom scope. They do not assert exclusive participation geography or conflate the English football pyramid with all UK football. No stadium, city, division, conference, logo, or contract facts have been invented to fill missing fields.

`entity_sequences.yaml` keeps numeric recipes in exactly two levels. Its string keys `"01"`/`"10"` form external sequence `01_10`; zero padding is preserved. Optional `terminology` names the numbers: family `athletes` is 5 and member `season_roster` is 22, so the named pair resolves to `05_22`. Member names are scoped to their family. The initial sequence is `[Sport, League, Conference, Division, Year, Team]`, with smaller profiles added for optional scoped lookup. Canonical definition codes are issued references and are not pure positional sequence strings, so this pilot does not apply `entity_sequence` annotations to them. Underscores stay inside components such as `HART_JOSH` and `SEASON_2022_2023`; dashes separate components.

For subsequent manifests, `entity_sequence: "05_22"`, `[5, 22]`, and `[athletes, season_roster]` select the same lookup. Alternatively set a family at file scope (`entity_sequence: athletes`) and members in groups (`entity_sequence: season_roster`). A member must be selected before records are defined. Names do not change the issued code or recipe meaning.

## Evidence and replay boundary

Every record inherits an official source URL or carries its own. Known publication dates are strings under `source.published_on`; undated pages omit that field. Source notes identify the sample and season-union meaning. Primary sources include the [NBA season index](https://www.nba.com/news/history-season-recaps-index), [NFL historical standings](https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2025/REG), [NHL records](https://records.nhl.com/standings/all-time-standings), and [Premier League season history](https://www.premierleague.com/en/premier-league-explained).

The membership examples cite the [Knicks Hart announcement](https://www.nba.com/knicks/news/new-york-knicks-acquire-josh-hart), [Broncos Sanders announcement](https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-agree-trade-emmanuel-sanders-to-49ers-draft-picks), and [Blues Leddy announcement](https://www.nhl.com/blues/news/blues-acquire-leddy-witkowski-from-red-wings-332085830). The separate annual histories cite the [official Raiders relocation announcement](https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state) and [Fulham promotion announcement](https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/2567479).

Ordinary replay must create missing records, retain existing values and memberships, add conflict-free aliases, and report differences. An omitted player is not a deletion instruction. The source-backed files support a preservation-oriented importer; the data alone does not make the legacy JSON seeders preservation-safe, reconcile duplicate live franchises, or alter existing database associations.

The AthleteAce integration tests import the original root-level pilot and verify replay, file relocation, preserved edits, missing-row reconstruction with changed numeric IDs, and the sample seasonal relationships. Expanded-catalog tests import every manifest recursively and verify all team counts, selected memberships against the capture, complete coverage for the three chosen teams, and reversed-order replay. These tests use the test database. See AthleteAce's `docs/yaml-seed-library.md` for import commands and remaining launch work.
